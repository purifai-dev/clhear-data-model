# clhear-data-model
CLHEAR Data Model is an open, standardised schema for encoding regulatory obligations, risks, controls, procedures, and evidence across the compliance lifecycle. It lets regulators, firms, and vendors map rules, policies, SOPs, Q&amp;As, and legal opinions into a shared machine-readable language for AI-ready, interoperable compliance.
